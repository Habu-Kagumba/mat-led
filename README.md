# Simple matatu-led advertisement screen demo(not responsive).

Coded a 3D perspective transform video embed to demonstrate matatu led screen advertisement.
It was for a simple demonstration so didn't even got into making it responsive.
Used this [gist](https://gist.github.com/fta2012/bd63f7fd9f385870efc0) from this [article](http://franklinta.com/2014/09/08/computing-css-matrix3d-transforms/).
